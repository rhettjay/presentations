## Overview:
- What is an IP Address?
  - What necessitates a version 6? What happened to version 5?
- What benefits does IPV6 offer over IPV4?
- Looking to the future
  - What can we expect the next 10 years to look like?

# [Review] What is an IP Address?
> IP Address are a digital representation of an network address used for host identification.
> An address consists of four of 4 sets of octets* or bytes. Each octect is 3 commonly represented as 1-3 digits.

</br>
</br>

For example:
```sh
185.107.800.231 #<-- IP address represented in digits
10111001 01101011 01010000 11100111 # <-- Represented in binary octet sets
```

# IPV4 Maths
>An octet has a highest possible value of 255 (i.e. 11111111).
>This is to say 0-255 (256) possible digits per octet.

$1byte=8bits$

$4bytes=(8*4)=32bits$

$256*256*256*256=256^4=2^{32}=4294967296\ possible\ values$

*This number is simply not high enough for each device to be assigned an address.*

## Result: We need another solution

# NAT (Network Address Translation)
IP Addresses are translated between public and private, s.t. each home, business, etc. has their own router which knows how to route calls internally to devices.

## NEED TO ADD PICTURE HERE BECAUSE THE MERMAID GRAPH ISN'T WORKING
```mermaid
graph TD;
  B[Router]-> C{ROUTER};
  Note over B,C: PUBLIC IP;
  C -->|Host - 192.168.1.121| D{NO PUBLIC IP};
  C -->|Host - 192.168.1.124| E{NO PUBLIC IP};
```

# IPV6: *the future has arrived*

> Q: What necessitates IPV6?:
> More addresses

Eight groups of four hexadecimal digits (or 128 bits / 16 bytes)
```sh
# Example
2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
```

$4*8=128\ bits = 16\ bytes$

$4^8=2^{128}= ~340\ undecillion\ possible\ addresses$

# What does this mean? (Pros/Cons)

## ~~NAT~~
Instead there are enough numbers for every device to be assigned a public IP address.

>We will still want to/need to rely on common firewall protections to avoid security breaches.

# Pros/Cons Cont.

Cloud IP allocation costs decrease because of higher supply of IP Addresses.
